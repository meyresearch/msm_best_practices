# Outline

This outline document lists all the relevant stages of the MSM creation process and the major questions/topics to be discussed. 

## Molecular dynamics simulations

- equilibrium vs non-equilibrium simulations
- capturing processes of interest 

## Different approaches

 1. 'Traditional' approach: featurization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, coarse-graining, e.g., PyEMMA/MSMbuilder
 2. Deep learning approach: e.g., VAMPnets
 3. Fine-grained approach: RMSD clustering
 4. Coarse-graining: PCCA, BACE, HMMs, Hummer/Szabo, Rosta-variational etc. 
## Modelling choices
 
- VAMP scores
- bootstrapping vs CV
- lag time
- number of coarse-grained states
- DL architecture? 
 
## Estimating uncertainty

- CV vs Bootstrap vs Bayes
